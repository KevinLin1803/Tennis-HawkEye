# Tennis-Hawkeye

## Introduction
This project simulates the tennis hawkeye system, analysing player speed and shots. YOLO models were trained to track the players(YOLOv8) and tennis ball(YOLOv5). Keypoints on the court were extracted using a CNN created with pyTorch. From this, player and shot speed were measured.
